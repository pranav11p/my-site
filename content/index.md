## Hey there! I'm Pranav!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I am a passionate software engineer based in Gujarat, India.

I have over 3 years of professional experience specializing in crafting robust APIs using Python and Django framework. My proficiency extends to DevOps, including managing production environments on AWS. Complementing my backend expertise, I also boast frontend skills, adept at building engaging UI/UX through React.

These days, I'm learning GoLang and have found fascination with Distributed Systems. I am also deeply invested in systems and architectures and how each small component builds the whole system around us.

Other than being software engineer, I love to watch Anime and sci-fi movies/web-series. Since last few months I have started hitting gym and honestly I'm loving it.

I'm all for connecting over our shared love for technology. Let's swap coding tips, geek out over latest tech, and spark some meaningful conversations :)
